Que:- What is Difference between Final, Finally and Finalize?

Ans:-

 (3) final class cannot be inherited.
 (4) Final method is executed only when we call it.
 
 Finally :-
 (1) finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not.
 (2) finally block cleans up all the resources used in try block
 (3) Finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed.
 
 Finalize:-
 
 (1) finalize method performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction.
