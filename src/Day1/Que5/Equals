Que1: -  What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what
         will be the output of the following code snippets and give with proper explanation.
         
    Ans :  
    
    The major difference between the == operator and .equals() method is that one is an 
    operator, and the other is the method. Both these == operators and equals() are used 
    to compare objects to mark equality. lets see the some differences between '==' and  .equals.
    
    
    1) '==' operator :-
       
        - It is considered an operator in Java. 
        - It is majorly used to compare the reference values and objects.
        - We can use the == operator with objects and primitives.
        - The == operator can’t compare conflicting objects, so at that time the compiler surrenders the compile-time error
        - == operator cannot be overridden.
        
    2) Equals() method : -
        - Equals() is considered as a method in Java.
        - It is used to compare the actual content of the object
        - We cannot use the equals method with primitives
        - The equals() method can compare conflicting objects utilizing
          the equals() method and returns “false”.       
        - Equals() method and can be overridden.
