Q2) Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?
Explain with an example.

Ans :--

----- Both expression gives you String object, but there is difference between them.
      When you create String object using new() operator, it always create a new object 
      in heap memory. On the other hand, if you create object using String literal
      syntax e.g. String s2 = "Test"; it may return an existing object from String pool
      (a cache of String object in Perm gen space, which is now moved to heap space in
      recent Java release), if it's already exists. Otherwise it will create a new 
      string object and put in string pool for future re-use.
