Q3) What are immutable classes in java? Create your own immutable classes in
Java?

Ans -- 

In Java, when we create an object of an immutable class, we cannot change its value.
For example, String is an immutable class. Hence, we cannot change the content of a
string once created. 

Besides, we can also create our own custom immutable classes.
 Here's what we need to do to create an immutable class.

1)--> declare the class as final so it cannot be extended
2)--> all class members should be private so they cannot be accessed outside of class
3)--> shouldn't contain any setter methods to change the value of class members
4)--> the getter method should return the copy of class members
5)--> class members are only initialized using constructor
